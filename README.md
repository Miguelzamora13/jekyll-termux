# jekyll on termux
I just made a simple script to setup 
jekyll on termux to help my friend 
maintain his jekyll hosted blog from 
phone


To use , first 
Install git 

apt install git

and clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/uttarayan21/jekyll-termux.git

then 
cd jekyll-termux 

and

./setup.sh
